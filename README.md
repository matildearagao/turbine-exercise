In the project directory, you must run:

### `npm run json:server`

Run the json-server in port 3000 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to fetch the data properly.


### `npm run start`

## About this app
This app was made as an exercise for Turbine.
I used React as Framework, Bootstrap for styling, Json-server to serve as an API for the database and Axios to fetch data from the API.
